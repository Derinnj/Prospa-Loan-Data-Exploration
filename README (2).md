# (Prosper Loan Data Exploration)


## by (Aderinsola Joseph)


## Dataset

The Prosper loan Dataset, made available by Udacity, is the dataset being used for this research. The dataset contains 113,937 loans and 81 characteristics. The majority of variables are category and numerical in character. Some popular variables which gave useable insights include

* Listing Category
* Loan Status
* Occupation
* Employment Status
* Loan Term etc

The dataset contains a tonne of additional intriguing factors, and for this project, we'll be investigating all of them to see how they interact. In order to analyse various relationships in the data set, we would also plot some visualisations utilising univariate, bivariate, and multivariate plots. A slidedeck presentation would also include some conclusions and noteworthy insights.

## Summary of Findings

In conducting this exploratory research, I was primarily interested in examining the information provided by the borrowers to discover any connections to the loans they had taken out.
One of the interesting facts found when examining the individual factors was that California State has the most borrowers. When I looked at the borrowers' employment status, I discovered that a large number of them were either employed or had full-time jobs. I found out more about their source of income and that it primarily falls between ($)25,000 and $74,999. I soon found that people's reasons for taking out loans were very different from what I had anticipated. The top three reasons were debt consolidation, home improvement, and business, while loans for boats and RVs came in last.

It was also important to note that a borrower's chances of receiving a larger loan increased if they were a homeowner, and that borrowers with verifiable income typically had loans with larger average amounts than those without. Compared to other occupations, professionals and computer programmers took out more loans. The loan terms were either for a duration of 12, 36, or 60 months, according to the loan documents. The majority of the loans have a 36-month term.

## Key Insights for Presentation

I would just concentrate on the various reasons people take out loans and the factors that affect their chance of getting a loan for my insight. To gain a basic understanding of who makes up the population, their occupations, and the states, I would start by looking at the demography of the debtors.
